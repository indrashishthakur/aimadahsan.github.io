        <p>One of the things I've always wanted to do but secretly been terrified of is writing. The idea that my thoughts read by the whole world sounded disastrous to me. Now after some thinking, an unbelievably small pro-cons list, I have taken a carefully weighed down decision to go for it. The universe has always given me reasons why a blog (or writing in more general) can be absolutely life changing experience and I figured its worth a shot. One more reason why I never got started with writing apart from my little phobia is that I've never been really a creative sorts of person. I always had doubts about what I'm going to write. I've decided to tackle this by writing about what I do which is not really much apart from some level of Python programming and few things here and there. But that should get me started, right?</p>
<p>Now, I should address some of the questions you might have about this blog (FAQs).</p>
<h3>Why 'HelloWorld.txt'?</h3>
<p>If you don't have a programming background, whenever you start out with a new language, you are supposed to write the first program that prints 'Hello World!' on the screen. This isn't programming but a new field and hence I thought about starting with a hello world post with little introduction that gets me acquainted with writing here.</p>
<h3>Why 'Blag'?</h3>
<p>You might have heard 'Good artists copy, great artists steal', now in no way I mean to imply that I'm a great artist (Pablo was indeed a great artist, I'm not even a decent one) so lets say the name was inspired (not stolen) from Randall Munroe's <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a></p>
<h3>Which technologies were used?</h3>
<p>This site is made possible with <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> which is a static site generator in Python. Its hosted on a GitHub repo (as the URL may suggest).</p>
<h3>Why static sites?</h3>
<p>I researched for long on creating a blog but didn't really liked Wordpress or Blogger. I stumbled upon static blogs using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is static site generator in Ruby. As a Python guy, I searched around for alternatives in Python and that's how I found <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. With static blogs, I have a whole different level of freedom because they require less maintenance, are way more secure (gone are worries of vulnerabilties with plugins and stuff) and most importantly they're cheaper. I just had to register a GitHub pages (which is FREE!) and push my generated site and I was good to go. Way less hassles, right?</p>
<h3>What should I expect on this blog?</h3>
<p>Don't expect anything because you might have heard that 'expectation is the root of all suffering'. But on a serious note, expect little tips and hacks I learn about, details about my projects (if they're worthy) or maybe mindless thoughts sometimes.</p>
<p>I guess I've been rambling here for a while so I'd like to put a stop to my train of thoughts now. I will (hopefully) come up with some cool stuff soon.</p>
<p>Adios!</p>
